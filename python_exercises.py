# This file is specifically for the python exercises that I do.

# Exercise: Ask the user to enter a word. The user could enter multiple words. Count the number of vowels and number of consonants in the words.
word = input("Please enter a word: ")
if n in word:
    if n in ("A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "a", "e", "i", "o", "u")
        print(n, "is a vowel")

# Exercise: Select a word, store it in some variable. Ask the user to enter a word. While the word is not the same as the word you selected, keep asking the user to enter a word. Stop when the two words are the same.
my_word = "gymnastics"
user_word = input("Enter a word: ")
while not my_word:
    user_word = input("Enter a word: ")
else:
    print("Thank you!")
