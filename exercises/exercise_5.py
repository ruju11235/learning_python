# Exercise 5:
# 1. You already know how to multiply two numbers.
# Ask the user to input two numbers and calculate the first number to the power second number.
# e.g. if user types 2 4, calculate 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16.
# 2. Read a sentence and read an alphabet from the user.
# - Print each letter in the sentence on a line.
# - Count the number of occurrences of the alphabet in the sentence and print it.

num_1 = input("Please enter a number: ")
num_2 = input("Please enter another number: ")
print("Your first number to the power your second number is")

sentence = input("Please enter a sentence: ")
